                <h2>Interface</h2>
                <p>
                    I wanted my website to reflect my principles and taste. It had to be simple, responsive, privacy-first and user-centric.
                </p>

                <h3>Colour</h3>
                <p>
                    To be responsive and user-centric, I should respect the user's preferred theme. The theme of the site changes along with the system theme. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I wanted to be subtle with a bright and warm colour for the light theme. And for the dark theme, I went with a midnightish dark grey.
                </p>

                <div class="color-card-container"> 
                    <div class="card-border"> 
                        <div class="color-card" style="background-color: #FCF9F8;"></div>
                        <div class="color-code"> #FCF9F8 </div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card-border"> 
                        <div class="color-card" style="background-color: #222830;"></div>
                        <div class="color-code"> #222830 </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3>Accent Colour</h3>
                <p>
                    I needed a brand colour. I like shades of green and blue. On exploring, I came across cornflower blue. Something about the hue, maybe the familiarity, or the tranquillity of it, I chose cornflower blue to be my accent shade.
                </p>

                <div class="color-card-container"> 
                    <div class="card-border"> 
                        <div class="color-card" style="background-color: #6495ED;"></div>
                        <div class="color-code"> #6495ED </div>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <p>
                    I kept the accents within the hyperlinks aligning with my idea of keeping it simple.
                </p>

                <h3>Typography</h3>
                <p>
                    One other primary goal for my website is to be super fast. So fast as if it was pre-installed. To achieve that, I've to cut down on loading resources as much as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A typical font file is around 50kB. And my home page is just around 30kB (27kB is taken up by my favicon).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thus, I decided to stick with the system fonts. I prefer sans serif to serif. So, I added all my preferred sans serif typefaces in my CSS, falling back to the system sans serif font. 
                </p>

                <h3>Images</h3>
                <p>
                    Images are resource-heavy, and I try to refrain from them as much as possible. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    But a portfolio without images would be bland. I've added images as it is in the portfolio for the time being. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am exploring efficient alternatives like dithered images and images with lower colour depth to replace current data-rich assets. This would significantly reduce the image bundle sizes.
                </p>

                <h3>Navigation</h3>
                <p>
                    A decluttered homepage and content pages resulted in more straightforward navigation. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I removed headers from all of the content pages. To go back, I gave a link in the subtitle.
                </p>

                <h2>Build System and Hosting</h2>
                <p>
                    To build my website, I was on the lookout for the perfect website builder, but I couldn't find one to my liking. In vain, I decided to code one myself from the ground up. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Writing one from scratch is okay, but it becomes a maintenance nightmare in the longer run. Some sort of a build pipeline is needed to ease maintainability. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    This was when I found Publish - a static site generator in Swift. Publish takes the load of converting the markdown files to structured HTML, and it is also flexible enough for me to write my plugins. With my custom CSS, it looks just the way I envisioned. 
                </p>

                <h3>Hosting</h3>
                <p>
                    The website is hosted on GitHub pages with my custom domain.
                </p>

                <h2>Next Steps</h2>
                <p>
                    I found that cornflower blue on my light background fails in contrast ratio. Though my site scored a 100 on the best practices in the Lighthouse report, it scored only a 93 on accessibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    My next step is to score a 100 on accessibility.
                </p>

                <p>
                    As I stated before, I am writing a Publish plugin to optimise all the image assets just before deployment. 
                </p>
