                <br />
                <p>There’s an old steel gate to our farm which doesn’t latch. One of the welds in the hinges gave up, rendering the gate unlatch-able.</p>
                
                <img src="images/gate-wide.jpg" />
                
                <p>Until the gate was fixed, as a workaround, people started to use a rope to keep the gate closed.</p>
                <p>So every time someone approached the gate, they</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Untie the rope</li>
                    <li>Enter the gate</li>
                    <li>Tie the rope back to latch it</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h2 class="port-h2">Problem</h2>
                <p>The problem was the knot.</p>
                <p>I observed that the knot on the gate changed often, and it was unpredictable. If I were lucky enough, I’d be blessed with a quick- release knot. Else, I’d be spending a good couple of minutes untying the world’s toughest knot.</p>
                
                <img src="images/knot-types.jpg" />
                
                <p>I can’t be the only one facing this. So I asked around my family; most of them felt the same. Realizing the problem here, I set out to solve it and provide a better experience for everyone.</p>

                <h2 class="port-h2">Goal</h2>
                <p>To design a latch that is usable by anyone and obviate the knot conundrum.</p>

                <h2 class="port-h2">Users</h2>
                <p>The gate is used mainly by the farmworkers, cattle herders, and my family. Construction workers are also using it since there’s a building going on inside.</p>
                <p>Almost all of them know how to tie a knot. But each one had their own variations. Even I tie a knot that’s different from others. There are a few kids who might not know how to form a knot. And there are the guests, who are the unknown variable here.</p>

                <h2 class="port-h2">Analysis</h2>

                <p>Once the rope is untied, the user is left with a blank slate.</p>

                <h3>Unlimited Options</h3>
                <ul><li>The user has to choose from the variety of knots they know. Thus increasing both the response time as well as their cognitive load.</li></ul>

                <h3>Rope length</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>The rope length was around 6 feet. Longer than what is required to form a basic knot around the gate.</li>
                    <li>The user has an implicit compulsion to use the whole length resulting in complex knots.</li>
                    <li>There are also reported attempts of people trying to steal the rope because of the length.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Knot direction ambiguity</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>If a user is walking out, they’ll knot from the outside, and if they are going in, the knot is on the inside.</li>
                    <li>This uncertainty hinders the subsequent user, who may walk in from the other direction.</li>
                </ul>
