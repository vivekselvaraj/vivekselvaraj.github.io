                <p>Watching movies and videos is one of the most common use cases of an iPad, yet the media playback controls in most of the video streaming
                    apps look non-iPad-like.</p>

                <h2>Publish</h2>
                <p>It was late last year when John talked about his special little project and how he would eventually
                    make it open source. It was a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers.</p>
                <p>He had built his website <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell</a> using Publish.
                    No JavaScript. Just pure HTML and CSS. The site was blazingly fast. The load time was almost
                    instant. Then I decided. If I ever launch a website, I'll have it JavaScript free. And here we are.
                </p>
                <h2>Catalyst</h2>
                <p>The time has come, and I have decided to generate my site using Publish. With the limited knowledge
                    of Swift that I had gained through the first 12 days of <a
                        href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, I created a starter
                    website and customised it to my needs.</p>
                <p>I've always wanted to try my hand at blogging, but I never thought I was good enough to write. A
                    recent <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088">tweet</a> by Paul Hudson
                    (the guy behind 100 Days of SwiftUI) was the catalyst that pushed me to do it.</p>
