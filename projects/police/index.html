                <h2>Problem</h2>
                <p>A major metro city police departmentâ€™s training academy wanted to streamline their training data management. </p>

                <h2>Summary</h2>
                <p>With my team I worked with a city police department training academy to help them streamline their training data management. As part of the  qualitative research, we conducted a series of semi-structured interviews with officers to better understand their current processes and pain points. Using affinity mapping we synthesized the information gathered and identified common themes and areas for improvement. Our findings helped the police department gain insights into their actual problems, enabling them to make informed decisions and streamline their training data management process for overall efficiency.</p>
