The podcast is not Swift oriented but they normally work on Swift projects. This is where I came to know about <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish.</a></p><p>I first heard about Publish, earlier this year when John was talking about this precious little project and how he is going to make it open source eventually. It is a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers. At that time I was still jumping from tutorial to tutorial on learning Swift and iOS development. I got inspired with his JavaScript free website, <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell.</a> In a world where all the JavaScript UI libraries were making noise, his website was attracting traffic without a single line of JavaScript code. I was impressed with how fast his website load time is and the fact that every single page on his website is generated using Publish.</p><p>I‚Äôve always had this idea of writing and publishing blog posts like every other ‚Äúinfluencer‚Äù developers do. But never had the spark or the confidence to actually write one. A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088">tweet</a> by Paul Hudson was the final catalyst that pushed me to do it.</p><p>Now that I've decided to write, I did not want to associate myself with blogging sites like Medium or Blogspot. <em>I wanted a simple tool to write like a pencil.</em> I decided to generate my site using Publish. Publish was in Swift. With the limited Swift knowledge I gained through the first 12 days of <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI,</a> I was able to understand how to work with Publish and customise it to my needs.</p><p>Welcome to <a href="vivek.dev">vivek.dev</a> üôè</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Handcrafted in Coimbatore with <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a><br/><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
