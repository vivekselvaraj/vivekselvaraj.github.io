Being a long time Apple follower, I got hooked immediately, and this is where I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>.</p><h2>Publish</h2><p>It was late last year when John talked about his special little project and how he would eventually make it open source. It was a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers.</p><p>He had built his website <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell</a> using Publish. No JavaScript. Just pure HTML and CSS. The site was blazingly fast. The load time was almost instant. Then I decided. If I ever launch a website, I'll have it JavaScript free. And here we are.</p><h2>Catalyst</h2><p>The time has come, and I have decided to generate my site using Publish. With the limited knowledge of Swift that I had gained through the first 12 days of <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, I created a starter website and customised it to my needs.</p><p>I've always wanted to try my hand at blogging, but I never thought I was good enough to write. A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088">tweet</a> by Paul Hudson (the guy behind 100 Days of SwiftUI) was the catalyst that pushed me to do it.</p><p>Welcome to <a href="/">vivek.dev</a> üôè</p></div></article></div><footer><p>Handcrafted in Coimbatore<br/><a href="/feed.rss">RSS feed</a></p></footer></body></html>
