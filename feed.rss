It's a podcast where they talk about Apple and what projects they are working on. Which are predominantly iOS and Swift projects. And I don't know Swift.</p><p>I started listening to Stacktrace when it used to be a podcast where they discuss Apple's leaks, news and rumours from a developer's perspective. I got hooked immediately. Overtime, it evolved into a podcast where they discuss Apple, Swift, their projects and indie development. This is where I first heard about <a href="https://github.com/JohnSundell/Publish">Publish</a>.</p><h2>Publish</h2><p>It was late last year, when John was talking about his precious little project and how he is going to make it open source eventually. It's a static site generator built with Swift for Swift developers. It was also the time where I was jumping from tutorial to tutorial trying to learn Swift and iOS development.</p><p>He had built his website <a href="https://www.swiftbysundell.com">Swift by Sundell</a> using Publish. No JavaScript. Just pure HTML and CSS. That site was blazingly fast. The load time was almost instant. Then I decided. If I ever launch a website, I'll have it JavaScript free.</p><h2>Catalyst</h2><p>The time has come. I have decided to generate my site using Publish. With the limited knowledge of Swift that I had gained through the first 12 days of <a href="https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui">100 Days of SwiftUI</a>, I was able to create a starter website, and customize it to my needs.</p><p>I've always wanted to try my hand at blogging, but I never thought I was good enough to write. A recent <a href="https://twitter.com/twostraws/status/1330559062803673088">tweet</a> by Paul Hudson (the guy behind 100 Days of SwiftUI) was the catalyst that pushed me to do it.</p><p>Welcome to <a href="https://vivek.dev/">vivek.dev</a> üôè</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
